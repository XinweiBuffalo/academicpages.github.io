I am a Ph.D. candidate in [Biostatistics](https://publichealth.buffalo.edu/biostatistics.html) at the University at Buffalo, under the supervision of [Dr. Saptarshi Chakraborty](https://www.saptarshichakraborty.net/). I am also serving as a research assistant at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center. Before coming to the U.S., I was a Ph.D. student in Statistics at National Chiao Tung University, working with [Dr. Weijing Wang](https://wjwang.stat.nycu.edu.tw/). I earned my Master's degree in Statistics from National Central University under the supervision of [Dr. Takeshi Emura](https://sites.google.com/view/statistician-takeshi).

My primary research focuses on modeling post-marketing data for signal detection by Bayesian shrinkage methods to improve pharmacovigilance practices. Addtionaly, I am instrested in multiplicity control for correlated endpoints. I am also actively working on (1) copula modeling for various data types, (2) survival analysis on recurrent events and semi-competing risks data, and (3) multiclass classification. I welcome collaboration on these and related topics.
