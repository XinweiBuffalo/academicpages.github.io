I am a Ph.D. candidate in [Biostatistics](https://publichealth.buffalo.edu/biostatistics.html) at the University at Buffalo, under the supervision of [Dr. Saptarshi Chakraborty](https://www.saptarshichakraborty.net/). I am also serving as a research assistant at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center. Before coming to the U.S., I was a Ph.D. student in Statistics at National Chiao Tung University, working with [Dr. Weijing Wang](https://wjwang.stat.nycu.edu.tw/). I earned my Master's degree in Statistics from National Central University under the supervision of [Dr. Takeshi Emura](https://sites.google.com/view/statistician-takeshi).

My primary research focuses on modeling post-marketing data for signal detection using Bayesian shrinkage methods to enhance pharmacovigilance practices. I am also actively involved in copula modeling, particularly for semi-competing risks data, recurrent cancer events, paired binary clinical data, and time series analysis. Collaboration on related topics is welcome.
