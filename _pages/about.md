I am a Ph.D. candidate in [Biostatistics](https://publichealth.buffalo.edu/biostatistics.html) at the University at Buffalo, advised by [Saptarshi Chakraborty](https://www.saptarshichakraborty.net/). My primary research focuses on modeling post-marketing data for signal detection using Bayesian shrinkage methods to enhance pharmacovigilance practices. Additionally, I serve as a research assistant in the [Department of Cancer Prevention & Control](https://www.roswellpark.org/research/departments/cancer-prevention-control) at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, where I primarily provide statistical support for immunology research. Before coming to the U.S., I was a Ph.D. student in Statistics at National Chiao Tung University, working with [Weijing Wang](https://wjwang.stat.nycu.edu.tw/). I earned my Master's degree in Statistics from National Central University under the supervision of [Takeshi Emura](https://sites.google.com/view/statistician-takeshi). Prior to that, I completed my Bachelor's degree at Fu Jen Catholic University, where I was supervised by Juei-Chao Chen.

Beyond my primary research, I have broader interests in:
1. Multiplicity control for correlated endpoints
2. Copula modeling for various data types
3. Survival analysis of recurrent events and semi-competing risks data
4. Machine learning methods for multiclass classification
I welcome collaborations on these and related topics and am open to discussing and reviewing papers.
